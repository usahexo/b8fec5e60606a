#  Mandela gambling online and drinking again – is he ok?

It has been revealed this week that Nelson Mandela is gambling online and drinking again. The 94-year-old former president of South Africa has a long history of health problems, including lung infections and prostate cancer. It is not clear whether he is currently seeking treatment for either issue.

Some close to Mandela are concerned that he may be reverting to his old vices in order to cope with the various health challenges he is currently facing. Gambling and alcohol were two of his biggest temptations during his 27 years in prison.

Mandela's grandson, Ndaba, recently told reporters that he was "not happy" about his grandfather's online gambling habit, saying "That's not how we want him to spend his time." But he also acknowledged that it is ultimately Mandela's choice how he spends his twilight years.

So far, Mandela has not commented on the latest reports about his health.

#  Is Mandela gambling again because he's depressed?

Former President Nelson Mandela is in the headlines again as allegations of him gambling at a casino surface, just two years after he was released from hospitalization for an acute respiratory infection. The 94-year-old has been noticeably absent from recent public engagements and his grandson has now come forward to say that Mandela is suffering from depression and has been gambling as a way to cope.

Mandela's health has been declining for some time and he was even hospitalized in December due to a lung infection. This latest news of his mental state and possible gambling addiction is very concerning, especially given how much he struggled with various health problems after being released from prison in 1990.

It's not clear how much money Mandela may have lost at the casino, but if he is indeed suffering from depression, it's likely that this is only making his condition worse. Gambling can be very addictive and it's possible that Mandela is already in over his head. It will be important to keep an eye on him and make sure that he gets the help he needs if it is found that he is struggling with a gambling addiction.

#  Mandela caught gambling online while drunk – will he face charges?

Nelson Mandela, 95, has been caught gambling online while drunk, according to local South African media. The former president and anti-apartheid hero is said to have lost about $1,500 in a single night of betting at an online casino.

The news has sparked outrage in South Africa, with many calling for Mandela to be prosecuted for breaking the country's gambling laws. However, it is unclear whether he will actually face any charges, as he is said to be too old and frail to stand trial.

This isn't the first time that Mandela has been caught up in a scandal. In 2013, he was forced to apologize after being accused of assault and adultery. And in 2009, he was hospitalized after being found unconscious at his home.

Mandela is a beloved figure in South Africa, but his recent behavior has raised questions about his mental health. Some have speculated that he may be suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

Whatever the cause of his problems, Mandela needs to get help before it's too late. If he doesn't take care of himself, he could end up ruining his reputation and legacy.

#  Do you think Mandela's gambling addiction is contributing to his alcoholism?

Mandela's gambling addiction is one possible contributing factor to his alcoholism, but it is not the only one. There are many reasons why people develop addictions, and it is likely that Mandela's addiction has multiple causes. Some people may be more prone to addiction than others, due to their genes or their early environment. Additionally, personal circumstances may contribute to an individual's vulnerability to addiction. For example, stress or loneliness may make someone more likely to drink or gamble compulsively. In Mandela's case, it is difficult to know exactly what factors led him to develop an addiction. However, it is clear that his addictions caused significant problems in his life and that he struggled with them for many years.

#  Mandela's been spending a lot of time gambling online – could it be ruining his life?

It’s no secret that Nelson Mandela, the former South African president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been struggling with some health issues in recent years. However, a new report suggests that one of his other problems may be gambling addiction.

According to the news outlet Eyewitness News, Mandela has been spending an inordinate amount of time playing casino games online – to the point where it’s allegedly taking a toll on his health and personal relationships. The article cites unnamed sources close to the situation who say that Mandela has lost a lot of money as a result of his online gambling habit, and that it’s caused strain between him and his wife Graca Machel.

Mandela is far from alone when it comes to gambling addiction; according to the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), around 2% of Americans are addicted to casino games. However, given Mandela’s high profile, this latest development is sure to raise eyebrows – and concern – among those who care about him.

So what can be done if Mandela does indeed have a gambling addiction? The first step is acknowledging that there’s a problem; after all, it’s much harder to address an issue if you don’t admit that you have one. If Mandela is willing to get help, there are a number of options available, including counseling, therapy, and self-help groups like Gamblers Anonymous.

Ultimately, it’s up to Mandela himself whether or not he wants to seek treatment for his gambling addiction. But with so many people worrying about him – not to mention the negative impact gaming could be having on his life – it may be time for him to take action.
