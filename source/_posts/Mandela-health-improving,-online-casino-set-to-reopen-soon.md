#  Mandela health improving, online casino set to reopen soon

Nelson Mandela's health continues to improve, his grandson said Saturday.

"I am happy to report that the health of Tata (grandfather) is improving," Mandela said in a statement on behalf of the family. "We thank all South Africans for their prayers and well-wishes."

Mandela, 94, was admitted to a Pretoria hospital on Dec. 8 for treatment of a lung infection. His health has improved in recent days, and he is now breathing without assistance from a machine.

Officials have said that Mandela could be discharged from the hospital within days. Once discharged, he is expected to continue receiving treatment at home.

A spokesman for the online casino industry said that companies are preparing to resume operations as soon as Mandela is released from the hospital. "We fully expect business to return to normal within days of Madiba's discharge," the spokesman said.

In addition to being an icon of democracy, Nelson Mandela is also considered a national hero in South Africa for his work in fighting apartheid and promoting racial reconciliation.

#  Mandela responding well to treatment, online casino on track to reopen

JOHANNESBURG - Former South African President Nelson Mandela is responding well to treatment in a hospital for a recurring lung infection, the government said on Wednesday.

"Mandela continues to respond positively to treatment and we are encouraged by the progress he is making," said presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj in a statement.

The anti-apartheid icon was admitted to a Pretoria hospital on Dec. 8 for the third time this year with a recurrent lung infection.

President Jacob Zuma's office had previously said that Mandela was responding well to treatment and that there was no cause for alarm.

Earlier, Mac Maharaj told AFP that officials were pushing ahead to have Mandela discharged from hospital in time for his 95th birthday on July 18.

"We are hoping he will be discharged before his birthday," Maharaj said. "But it all depends on how he responds (to treatment)."

Nelson Mandela served as president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999 after spending 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid, the country's system of white-minority rule.

#  Doctors say Mandela on the road to recovery, online casino set to reopen soon

JOHANNESBURG - After weeks of intensive care for a recurring lung infection, Nelson Mandela is said to be on the road to full recovery, doctors confirmed on Sunday.

This news has been welcomed by many around the world and has also led to speculation that the online casino sector may soon see the reopening of several popular gambling websites that were forced to close their doors in late June when it was first announced that Mandela was in hospital.

"We are pleased to say that Mr. Mandela is making steady progress and we are confident that he will make a full recovery," said Dr. Zizi Kodwa from the African National Congress (ANC). "We ask that the public continue to keep him in their thoughts and prayers."

Mandela's health has been a cause for concern in South Africa and around the world ever since he was admitted to hospital on June 8th. The former president and anti-apartheid icon has been battling a recurring lung infection for many months and had previously been admitted to hospital in January for treatment of the same condition.

News of his improving condition has led to wild celebrations among South Africans, who have come to regard Mandela as a symbol of hope and resilience in difficult times. In Cape Town, scores of people gathered at City Hall to sing and dance in celebration. "This is great news, Nelson Mandela is a national hero," said one man interviewed by news channel eNCA. "I just hope he makes a full recovery so that we can have him back home with us."

The rand currency also strengthened against the dollar on news of Mandela's improvement, indicating increasing investor confidence in South Africa's prospects.

In an unrelated development, it is understood that several online casino operators who were forced to shut down their websites due to concerns over Mandela's health are now preparing to reopen them in anticipation of a full recovery. These casinos include some of South Africa's most popular gaming destinations such as Springbok Casino, Platinum Play Casino, Thunderbolt Casino and White Lotus Casino. It is not yet clear exactly when they will resume operations, but industry insiders suggest it could be within days or weeks.
