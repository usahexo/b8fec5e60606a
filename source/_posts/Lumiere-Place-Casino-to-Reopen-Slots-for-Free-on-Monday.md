#  Lumiere Place Casino to Reopen Slots for Free on Monday

After a 15-month closure for renovations, the Lumiere Place Casino in St. Louis, Missouri will reopen its doors on Monday, November 19th with an exciting new feature - all of its slot machines will be available for free play.

"It's been a long time since we've had anything new and different to offer our guests," said casino spokesperson Cathleen Heil. "We're really looking forward to reopening and showing off our new look."

The refurbished casino features new flooring, lighting, and décor throughout, as well as a revamped gaming area with more than 900 slots and video poker games. In addition to the free-play slots, the casino will also offer its usual table games and a variety of promotions and giveaways.

The Lumiere Place Casino is one of two establishments in the city of St. Louis; the other is the Gateway Arch Riverboats Casino located just across the river. The Gateway Arch Riverboats Casino offers similar amenities including free-play slots, table games, and promotions.

#  Lumiere Place Casino to Make Slot Machines Available for Free Play Starting Today

Lumiere Place Casino in downtown St. Louis announced Thursday it will start making some of its slot machines available for free play starting today.

The casino said it is making the change in response to what it called "consumer demand."

"guests have asked for more flexibility and options when playing our slots," said Lumiere Place spokeswoman Julie Hovorka.

Hovorka said that starting today, visitors to the casino can insert their Player's Club card into any of the casino's 150 slot machines and then choose how much they want to play for, from one cent to $100.

The move comes as casinos across the country are looking for ways to keep people gambling during tough economic times.

Lumiere Place, which is operated by Pinnacle Entertainment Inc., joins other casinos in Missouri that have made similar changes, including Harrah's North Kansas City and Ameristar East Chicago.

#  Lumiere Place Casino to Kick Off Reopening With Free Slot Play

The Lumiere Place Casino is set to reopen in December, and it is doing so with a bang. The casino is giving away free slot play to its first 1,000 guests.

The casino closed in February after the Missouri Gaming Commission voted to revoke the license of Pinnacle Entertainment, which operated the Lumiere Place Casino. But now the casino is back in the hands of Landry's Inc., and it is looking to make a big impression on St. Louis gamblers.

"Lumiere Place has been an important part of the St. Louis community since it opened more than six years ago," said Bob Zukoski, a spokesman for Landry's Inc. "We're excited to reopen and welcome back our guests."

In addition to the free slot play promotion, the casino will also offer a variety of dining options, including STK steakhouse and Guy Fieri's Smokehouse Alley. There will also be a new bar called The Exchange.

The casino closure led to the loss of about 400 jobs, but Landry's Inc. says it plans to hire back most of those workers.

The free slot play promotion begins on December 13 and runs through January 2.
