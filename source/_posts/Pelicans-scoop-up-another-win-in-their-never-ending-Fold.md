#  Pelicans scoop up another win in their never-ending Fold

The New Orleans Pelicans continue to rewrite the history books as they win their Franchise-record 21st consecutive game. The Pelicans defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 122-98 on Monday night, led by Anthony Davis’s 29 points.

Davis was one of six players in double figures for New Orleans, which shot 56.6 percent overall and made 17 of 34 3-pointers (50 percent). Jrue Holiday scored 21 points, Elfrid Payton had 14, Darius Miller 13 and E'Twaun Moore 10.

This streak started with a win against the Portland Trail Blazers on January 7th and they have not looked back since then. What makes this streak even more impressive is that they have been doing it without their superstar player, Anthony Davis. With Davis back in the lineup, the Pelicans are only going to get stronger.

The Pelicans are now one game away from tying the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for the second-longest winning streak in NBA history. It will be very exciting to see if they can actually break that record.

However, they are not done yet. They still have four games left on their current road trip and they need to continue to win in order to keep the streak alive. The first game of the road trip was against the Detroit Pistons and it was not an easy game by any means. The Pistons were up by as many as 20 points in the first half but the Pelicans stormed back in the second half and ended up winning 122-119.

Jrue Holiday led the way for New Orleans with 34 points while Anthony Davis added 32 points. This was a huge win for them as it showed that they are not going to give up no matter how far behind they are. They are always going to fight until the end and that is what has led them to this incredible streak.

The next game of their road trip is against the Toronto Raptors on Wednesday night. This is going to be another tough test for them but I believe that they will come out victorious. The Raptors are a very good team but I think that the Pelicans are just too hot right now.

#  How the fold gave New Orleans the Pelicans an edge

The New Orleans Pelicans basketball team is one of the most exciting teams in the NBA to watch. This year, they proved that they have what it takes to make it to the playoffs. But how did this small-market team make it so big?

It all comes down to their home court advantage. The Smoothie King Center, where the Pelicans play their home games, has a really cool feature that gives them an edge over their opponents: the fold.

The fold is a section of seating in the Smoothie King Center that sits directly above the players’ benches. It’s called the fold because when it’s folded up, it creates a canopy over the court that blocks out the sun and distracts opposing players.

This is a huge advantage for the Pelicans, who are used to playing in bright sunlight. When they play at home, they know that their opponents will be struggling to see while they’re basking in the shade.

The fold became a key factor in the Pelicans’ success this year. They were able to use it to gain an edge over their opponents, and it helped them to secure some important wins during playoff season.

#  What is a fold in online poker and how does it work?

When you fold in poker, you forfeit your chance to win the current hand, but you also don't have to risk any of your own money. This is a great option if you don't think you have the best hand and don't want to risk any more money on the hand. You can also fold if you're not sure what your best move is or if there are too many opponents left in the hand.

There are a few different types of folds that you can make in poker, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks. The most common fold is the regular fold, which just means that you're folding your cards and ending your turn. Another common fold is the check-fold, which happens when you check your hand but then decide to fold after someone else bets. This is usually done when you don't think you have the best hand and don't want to risk any more money.

There are also a few more specialized folds that you can make in poker. One example is the lead-out fold, which is when you put out a small bet in hopes of getting someone to call so that you can then fold on the next round. This can be a risky strategy, but it can also be very effective if used correctly. There are also bluff folds, which are when you fold even though you think you might have the best hand. This can be a risky move, but it can also be very effective if done correctly.

#  Faulty fold gives New Orleans Pelicans another victory

The New Orleans Pelicans are on a roll. Winners of 5 in their last 6, the Pelicans are starting to gel as a unit led by Anthony Davis. The latest victory came against the Oklahoma City Thunder with Davis scoring 34 points and grabbing 18 rebounds.

One big reason for the resurgence has been the play of Jrue Holiday who is averaging over 20 points and over 8 assists in the month of December. Rajon Rondo, who was acquired from the Chicago Bulls in the off-season, has been a steadying influence on the Pelicans squad and is averaging nearly 10 assists per game.

While it is fair to say that most NBA teams have struggled this season, the Pelicans have been hit particularly hard by injuries. Starting point guard Elfrid Payton has missed most of December with a hamstring injury and key reserve Nikola Mirotic has also been sidelined with an illness.

The return of Payton and Mirotic could not come soon enough for Alvin Gentry's squad as they look to make a run at one of the final playoff spots in the Western Conference.

#  Pelican's fold gives them an early lead

The Seattle Mariners were looking to take an early lead in their game against the Houston Astros, but the Astros' pitchers had other plans. The Mariners batters couldn't seem to get anything going and the Astros took a 3-0 lead into the bottom of the third inning. However, that's when things started to turn around for the Mariners.

In the bottom of the third inning, Robinson Cano hit a double, which was then followed by a single from Nelson Cruz. That brought home Cano and cut the Astros' lead down to 3-1. Then in the bottom of the fourth inning, Kyle Seager hit a home run, which brought the Mariners' within one run of the Astros.

The Mariners weren't done yet though. In the bottom of the sixth inning, Jean Segura hit a triple and then scored on a single from Mike Zunino. That gave the Mariners a 5-4 lead and they would never look back. The Mariners bullpen held up well and they came away with a 5-4 victory.

This was an important victory for the Mariners as it pulled them within four games of first place in the AL West division. They will look to continue this momentum in their next game against the Astros.
