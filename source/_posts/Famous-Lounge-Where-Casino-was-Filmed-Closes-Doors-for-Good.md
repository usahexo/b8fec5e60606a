#  Famous Lounge Where Casino was Filmed Closes Doors for Good

The casino lounge that was used as the filming location for the Martin Scorsese movie “Casino” is set to close its doors for good. The closure is due to financial difficulties and the fact that the property has been on the market for sale for a number of years without any buyers coming forward.

The casino lounge, which is located in downtown Las Vegas, first opened its doors back in 1992. At that time, it was known as Aladdin’s Lounge and it was one of the most popular places to gamble in Sin City. However, things began to take a turn for the worse in 2007 when the property was taken over by new owners.

Since then, the casino lounge has been through a number of different name changes and ownership changes, but it has never managed to return to its former glory. In fact, things have only gotten worse in recent years, with the casino lounge reporting losses of $1 million last year.

As a result of this, the owner of the property has decided to close its doors for good. This will come as a huge blow to fans of the movie “Casino”, who have been visiting the casino lounge ever since it was used as a filming location back in 1995.

#  Sad Day for Fans of the Famous Lounge Where Casino was Filmed

The casino lounge that was the backdrop for Martin Scorsese's 1995 film "Casino" will be closing its doors for good this weekend. The establishment has been a Las Vegas mainstay since the 1970s, but its popularity has faded in recent years.

In the movie, the lounge was known as the Tangiers, and it was here that Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro) and Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) plotted their schemes and waged their turf wars. The lounge was a key setting in the movie and helped to create its iconic atmosphere.

Fans of the movie are sure to be disappointed by the closure of the Tangiers Lounge. Many of them have probably spent countless hours in the establishment over the years, enjoying its vintage feel and talking about their favorite scenes from the movie.

It's unclear what will happen to the lounge once it closes. Possibilities include turning it into a new casino or redeveloping it into something else entirely. Whatever happens, it's sure to be sad news for fans of "Casino" who loved spending time in the Tangiers Lounge.

#  What Happened to the Famous Lounge Where Casino was Filmed?

In December of 2014, the popular movie Casino was filmed at the lounge inside of the Tropicana hotel and casino in Las Vegas. The lounge was a popular spot for locals and tourists alike, as it offered great views of the Strip.

But what happened to the lounge after the movie was filmed? It appears that it has since been closed down. A quick Google search shows that there is little information available about what happened to the space.

It's possible that the closure is simply due to renovations or a change in management, but it's also possible that the lounge was shut down because of its connection to the movie Casino. After all, the lounge was prominently featured in the film and offered a unique view of the Strip.

Whatever happened to the lounge, it's definitely a shame that it's no longer open to the public. It offered a unique glimpse into Las Vegas history and was a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.

#  Casino Lounge Closure a Blow to Local Economy

The news of the closure of the Casino Lounge, a popular casino and lounge in the heart of the city, has come as a blow to the local economy. The casino, which has been in business for over two decades, is a major employer in the area, and its closure will leave hundreds of people out of work.

In addition to the job losses, the closure will also have a negative impact on local businesses. The Casino Lounge was a major purchaser of goods and services in the area, and its closure will lead to a significant reduction in spending. This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on local businesses, many of which are already struggling.

It is hoped that someone will step forward to purchase the casino and keep it open. However, given the current state of the economy, this may be difficult to achieve. If the casino does close its doors for good, it will be a major blow to the local economy.

#  Loss of Casino Lounge Bad News for Employees

The closure of the Casino Lounge in early December was a huge disappointment to employees and customers alike. The popular casino and lounge had been a landmark in the city for many years, and its sudden closure left many people out of work.

The lounge had been struggling financially for some time, and officials made the decision to close it down in order to avoid bankruptcy. This came as a shock to employees, who were not given any warning that the casino was in trouble.

Many of the employees had worked at the casino for many years, and they were devastated by the news. Some decided to pursue other options, while others are hoping that another casino in the city will be willing to hire them.

Customers were also disappointed by the closure. They enjoyed spending time at the casino, and they were saddened by the fact that it was no longer available. Some are hoping that another casino will open up in the city soon so that they can enjoy their favourite pastime once again.

Overall, the closure of the Casino Lounge has been a big loss for both employees and customers. It is hoped that something can be done to reopen it soon so that everyone can benefit from its existence once again.
