#  Casino Reports $3 Million in Losses Over the Weekend

Casinos across Nevada reported $3 million in losses over the weekend. This is the first time in nearly two years that gambling revenues have dipped below the $3 million mark.

Experts are attributing the decline to several factors, including increasing competition from new casinos in Southern Nevada, as well as a decrease in tourism visitation. The latter has been affected by recent nationwide protests and a travel advisory issued by the Mexican government.

The poor weekend performance comes on the heels of a strong July, which saw casino revenues top $4 million for the first time this year. In fact, over the past 12 months, gambling revenues have increased by 2.5%.

While casino officials acknowledge that there is some volatility in gambling revenues, they remain optimistic that business will continue to improve moving forward.

#  San Manuel Casino Online Announces Changes to Player Rewards Program

The San Manuel Casino, located in the heart of California's Inland Empire, has just announced a major change to their player rewards program.

The new program, called "Passport Rewards," is designed to give players greater flexibility and more opportunities to earn rewards.

"We are always looking for ways to improve our players' experience," said Jerry Lukis, President of the San Manuel Casino. "Passport Rewards provides an innovative way for players to earn rewards that they can use both at our casino and at other partner casinos."

How does it work? Players will earn passport points for every dollar they spend on slot machines and table games. These points can then be used to redeem rewards such as free play, hotel stays, dining credits, and more.

Additionally, players will now have the ability to transfer their passport points between San Manuel Casino and its partnered casinos. This means that if you earn a free night's stay at one casino, you can use it at any of the other partner casinos as well.

The San Manuel Casino is one of the largest tribal casinos in the United States, with over 4,000 slot machines and nearly 200 table games. It also offers a variety of restaurants, including the world-famous Soboba Buffet.

#  Casino Reports Fourth Quarter Loss of Nearly $2.5 Million

The management team at Casino Corporation released a report today indicating that the company had suffered a net loss of $2.464 million during the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year. This represented a substantial increase from the net loss of $644,000 that the company had reported for the same quarter in the previous fiscal year.

Revenue for the quarter was also down, falling from $13.8 million to $10.3 million. This decline was attributed to lower than expected admissions and restaurant sales. In addition, costs increased significantly, with the company spending more on marketing and administrative expenses.

The CEO of Casino Corporation issued a statement commenting on the results. “We are disappointed with our performance in the fourth quarter,” he said. “However, we remain optimistic about our prospects for future growth. We are committed to making the necessary improvements to ensure that we deliver value to our shareholders.”

The company is expecting improved performance over the coming year, with revenue and earnings both projected to grow modestly. In addition, the management team is planning to invest in new marketing initiatives and pursue other opportunities for growth.

#  Casino Reports Net Loss of $6.7 Million in First Quarter

Las Vegas, NV - The city's casinos reported a net loss of $6.7 million in the first quarter of this year, according to figures released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This compares with a net profit of $2.8 million in the first quarter of last year.

The decrease was attributable to a decline in gaming revenue, which fell 3.9% from the same period last year. Slot machine revenue was down 5%, while table game revenue was down 1.5%.

However, there was some good news in the report. Non-gaming revenue, which includes hotel, restaurant and other entertainment income, increased by 2%. This helped offset the decline in gaming revenue and resulted in an overall decrease in net revenue of only 2%.

"The gaming industry is continuing to face significant headwinds," said Mike Lawton, senior research analyst with the Control Board. "However, the non-gaming sector is performing well, and that is helping to offset much of the losses."

Despite the overall decline, a number of casinos reported increases in revenue. The Golden Nugget had the largest increase, at 12%, followed by The Cromwell (10%) and SLS Las Vegas (8%).
