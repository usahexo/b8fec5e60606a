#  Gambler walks away with $1,200 after playing black jack in Senegal!

Gambler Ahmed walked away from a black jack table in Senegal with more than $1,200 after playing for just a few minutes, Reuters reports.

Ahmed, who was visiting the West African country as a tourist, reportedly put down just 100 CFA francs—about 15 U.S. cents—and won 1,200 CFA francs, or about $2.10

“I was so happy when I won. I couldn’t believe it,” Ahmed told Reuters.

Black jack is a popular casino game where players bet against the house on the outcome of cards drawn from a shoe. A player wins if the first two cards dealt are an Ace and a 10-point card or “king, queen or jack”—a so-called “natural”—or if the dealer goes bust by exceeding 21 points.

Ahmed’s windfall comes at a time when gambling is on the rise in Senegal. Casino operators in the country say they have seen business increase by as much as 20 percent in recent years, Reuters reports.

#  How to win at black jack in Senegal - payouts of 3 to 2 await!

Blackjack is a casino game where you are playing against the dealer. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, and beat the dealer's hand. In Senegal, blackjack is offered with 3:2 payouts, which makes it one of the best bets in the casino!

In order to win at blackjack in Senegal, there are a few basic tips that you need to follow. First, always remember that the aim of the game is to beat the dealer, not to get as close to 21 as possible. This means that if you have a hand worth 19, for example, you should stand rather than take another card in an effort to make 21.

 secondly, always remember that you can't go over 21 - if you have a total of 22 for example, you automatically lose even if the dealer also has 22. This is called busting and it's important to avoid it at all costs.

Thirdly, be aware of what cards are left in the deck - this will help you determine whether to hit or stand. For example, if there are only low cards left in the deck, you are more likely to hit than if there are high cards left.

Finally, always remember to use your betting strategy! There are different betting strategies that can help increase your chances of winning at blackjack - one of them is simply doubling down on your bet when you have a good hand.
