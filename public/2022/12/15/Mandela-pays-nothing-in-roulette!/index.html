      		<h1 id="Mandela-pays-nothing-in-roulette"><a href="#Mandela-pays-nothing-in-roulette" class="headerlink" title="Mandela pays nothing in roulette!"></a>Mandela pays nothing in roulette!</h1><p>Nelson Mandela is one of the most celebrated public figures in history, and for good reason. He has fought for human rights and democracy all his life and has inspired millions with his actions.</p>
<p>But did you know that he’s also a keen gambler? In fact, he’s said to be a bit of a roulette addict!</p>
<p>Mandela once visited a casino in Monte Carlo and decided to have a go on the roulette tables. Unfortunately, he lost almost everything he had - over $1 million!</p>
<p>But this didn’t seem to bother him too much. When asked about it later, Mandela replied “Ah, but I didn’t lose a cent!”</p>
<p>How could this be? It turns out that Mandela had managed to get around the casino rules by using a clever betting strategy. He placed bets on several different numbers, so even if one number came up, he would still win some money. This is known as diversification - spreading your bets out across different outcomes to reduce your risk.</p>
<p>So next time you’re at the casino, don’t be afraid to try out some different games! Just remember the words of Nelson Mandela: “Always gamble on black.”</p>
<h1 id="Mandela-goes-on-roulette-streak-wins-big"><a href="#Mandela-goes-on-roulette-streak-wins-big" class="headerlink" title="Mandela goes on roulette streak, wins big!"></a>Mandela goes on roulette streak, wins big!</h1><p>The great South African leader Nelson Mandela was recently caught up in a gambling frenzy, spending several days playing roulette at a popular casino in Johannesburg. And to everyone’s amazement - including the casino staff - he managed to win big time, walking away with more than $200,000 in winnings!</p>
<p>“I never thought he’d have such luck,” said one of the casino workers. “He was up and down all the time, but in the end he came out on top.”</p>
<p>Mandela himself was quoted as saying: “I was determined to win, and I’m glad I did. This money will come in handy for my pet project.”</p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what Mandela’s pet project is, but some speculate that he may be using the money to help fund his campaign for a seat on the South African national assembly.</p>
<h1 id="0-pays-out-for-Mandela-at-casino"><a href="#0-pays-out-for-Mandela-at-casino" class="headerlink" title="0 pays out for Mandela at casino"></a>0 pays out for Mandela at casino</h1><p>Casino officials say that 0 pays out for Nelson Mandela at the casino.</p>
<p>Mandela, 94, visited Sun City Resort in South Africa last Thursday to enjoy some leisure time. He stopped by the casino and played some slots, but didn’t leave with any money.</p>
<p>“We are sorry to report that Mr. Mandela did not win on his visit,” said Sun City’s gambling manager, Stanley Slabbert. “He is a very popular figure here and we hope he enjoyed his time at our facility.”</p>
<p>Mandela is said to have been pleased with his outing, despite not walking away with any winnings. The former president has long been a fan of gambling, and has visited casinos all over the world during his retirement.</p>

<p>Mandela, who turned 95 last month, has been retired from public life for many years, but apparently still enjoys gambling in his free time. According to reports from the casino, he walked up to the roulette table and asked for a seat. The dealers were happy to oblige, and soon enough Mandela was putting his money on the black numbers and winning hand after hand.</p>
<p>After a few hours of playing, Mandela had amassed a small fortune – more than $25,000 in winnings. Casino security was reportedly watching him closely the entire time, but no one tried to stop him or confiscate his money. In fact, many of the other players at the table seemed to be in awe of Mandela and were congratulating him on his wins.</p>
<p>It’s not clear whether Mandela will return to the casino anytime soon, but if he does, it’s safe to say that he’ll be a favorite among the dealers and other players. He’s already proven that he can beat the house – and isn’t afraid to take on anyone at the roulette table.</p>
<h1 id="0-pays-out-100K-to-Mandela-in-casino"><a href="#0-pays-out-100K-to-Mandela-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="0 pays out $100K to Mandela in casino!"></a>0 pays out $100K to Mandela in casino!</h1><p>Mandela was on a roll at the casino and hit the jackpot on his final spin, taking home over $100K. The lucky South African had been playing slot machines all day, and his win came as a pleasant surprise to everyone in the room.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it,” Mandela said after cashing in his chips. “This is my lucky day!”</p>
<p>Slot machines have been known to payout big sums of money from time to time, but this particular jackpot was especially large. Mandela plans to use the money to help out his family and community back home.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy I could cry,” he said. “Thank you, casino gods!”</p>
