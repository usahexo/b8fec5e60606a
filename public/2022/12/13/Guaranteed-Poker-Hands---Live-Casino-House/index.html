      		<h1 id="Guaranteed-Poker-Hands-Live-Casino-House"><a href="#Guaranteed-Poker-Hands-Live-Casino-House" class="headerlink" title="Guaranteed Poker Hands - Live Casino House"></a>Guaranteed Poker Hands - Live Casino House</h1><p>When you play at a land-based casino, there are certain poker hands that are almost always winners. Some of these hands are so strong that they are called “guaranteed poker hands.” If you want to increase your chances of winning at the casino, it’s important to know which hands these are.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the five best guaranteed poker hands and how to play them. We will also provide some tips on how to maximize your winnings when playing these hands. So let’s get started!</p>
<h1 id="The-Royal-Flush"><a href="#The-Royal-Flush" class="headerlink" title="The Royal Flush"></a>The Royal Flush</h1><p>The royal flush is the most powerful hand in poker and is a guaranteed winner every time. This hand consists of five cards of the same suit, with the ace being high. To win with a royal flush, you must have all of the cards in the same suit. For example, if you have an ace, two, three, four and five of clubs, you have a royal flush.</p>
<p>Royal flushes are very rare, so don’t expect to hit one every time you play. However, when you do get lucky and hit this hand, it can be very profitable!</p>
<h1 id="The-Straight-Flush"><a href="#The-Straight-Flush" class="headerlink" title="The Straight Flush"></a>The Straight Flush</h1><p>The straight flush is another very powerful hand in poker and is also a guaranteed winner. This hand consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as two, three, four, five and six of clubs. As with the royal flush, you must have all of the cards in the same suit to win with a straight flush.</p>
<p>Straight flushes are slightly more common than royal flushes but still not something that you will see often. When you do hit one though, it can be very lucrative!</p>
<h1 id="Four-Of-A-Kind"><a href="#Four-Of-A-Kind" class="headerlink" title="Four Of A Kind"></a>Four Of A Kind</h1><p>Four of a kind is another extremely strong hand in poker and is also a guaranteed winner most of the time. This hand consists of four cards of the same rank and one random card. For example, if you have four queens and two other random cards, you have four of a kind.</p>
<p>Four of a kind is not quite as strong as a royal flush or straight flush but it is still a very powerful hand that should not be underestimated. In most cases, you will want to bet big when holding four of a kind in order to make sure that your opponents fold their weaker hands.</p>
<h1 id="Full-House"><a href="#Full-House" class="headerlink" title="Full House"></a>Full House</h1><p>A full house is another extremely strong hand in poker and is usually a guaranteed winner. This hand consists of three cards of the same rank and two random cards. For example, if you have three kings and two other random cards, you have a full house. As with the hands listed above, full houses should be bet big in order to make sure that your opponents fold their weaker hands.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Guarantee-Winning-Poker-Hands"><a href="#How-to-Guarantee-Winning-Poker-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How to Guarantee Winning Poker Hands"></a>How to Guarantee Winning Poker Hands</h1><p>In poker, there are many different ways to win a hand. However, there are some basic concepts that will help guarantee victory more often than not. The following guide will teach players how to make the best possible hands, and how to use those hands to dominate their opponents.</p>
<p>The first step to guarantee winning poker hands is understanding the rank of hands. In most varieties of poker, the highest ranking hand is a royal flush - consisting of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten of the same suit. Following this is a Straight Flush - five cards in sequence all of the same suit. After that comes four of a kind, then a full house, then aflush, then a straight, and finally three of a kind.</p>
<p>With this knowledge in hand, players can begin to construct the best possible hands. The simplest way to do this is by starting with the highest ranking card and working down. For example, if a player has an Ace and two other clubs, they could make either a royal flush (Ace of clubs through 10 of clubs) or a straight flush (Ace through 5 of clubs). If they instead have an Ace and two other spades, they could make either a royal flush (Ace of spades through 10of spades) or four of a kind (Aces).</p>
<p>Players should also be aware of which suits are ‘winning suits’. In most variants of poker, the suits are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. This means that if two players have the same ranked hand (eg two players both have threeofakind), the player with the higher ranking card in their winning suit will win the hand. For example, if both players have threeofakinds but one player has an Ace while the other player has a 5 ,the first player will win as their Ace is part of their winning suit (spades).</p>
<p>With this knowledge in mind, players can put together some powerful hands that are difficult for their opponents to beat. By starting with high ranking cards and using winning suits when possible,. players can create strong hands that are likely to take down any competition.</p>
<h1 id="Guaranteed-Poker-Hands-from-the-Live-Casino-House"><a href="#Guaranteed-Poker-Hands-from-the-Live-Casino-House" class="headerlink" title="Guaranteed Poker Hands from the Live Casino House"></a>Guaranteed Poker Hands from the Live Casino House</h1><p>There are certain poker hands which are more likely to occur when playing at a live casino house as opposed to an online one. This is due in part to the ability of players to see each other’s cards in a land-based setting, allowing them to make better decisions about when and how to bet. Here we take a look at some of the most common and profitable hands you can expect to see while playing at a brick and mortar establishment.</p>
<p>The first hand we will look at is the Royal Flush, which is made up of the ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit. This is by far the most profitable hand in poker and will often result in a large payout from the casino. While it may not be possible to achieve on every given hand, it’s still worth keeping an eye out for should someone else happen to get lucky and hit one.</p>
<p>Another strong hand that can often be found in live games is Four of a Kind. This comprises four cards of the same rank, such as four kings or four jacks. Again, this is not always possible but it’s definitely worth betting on if it comes your way as it can often result in a big payout from the casino.</p>
<p>Another common hand which can be found at both online and offline casinos alike is the Full House. This is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three queens and two sixes. If you are lucky enough to hold this hand then you should definitely bet big in order to maximize your winnings.</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Straight Flush which is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. This is another very strong hand which can often lead to a big payout from the casino if it goes your way. Just like with the other hands listed here, it’s not always possible to achieve but it’s definitely worth keeping an eye out for just in case.</p>

This is a place where you can find all the games you love, and more importantly, where you can hone your skills and strategies. Here are some tips on how to make the most of your time at the live casino house:</p>
<p>Choose the game that’s best for you: There are a wide range of games available at the live casino house, so it’s important to choose the one that’s best suited to your playing style. If you’re someone who likes fast-paced action, then blackjack or roulette might be right for you. Conversely, if you prefer a more relaxed experience, then you might want to try out some of the slot games.</p>
<p>Find a game with low stakes: Another thing to keep in mind when choosing a game is the stakes. It’s important to find a game that has stakes that fit within your budget. That way, you can enjoy yourself without having to worry about losing too much money.</p>
<p>Play with friends: One great thing about playing at the live casino house is that it’s a great opportunity to socialize with friends. Not only will this make the experience more enjoyable, but it can also help improve your skills as a poker player.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect: One of the most important things when it comes to poker is practice. The more you play, the better you’ll become at evaluating hands and making strategic decisions. So be sure to take advantage of all the opportunities available at the live casino house to improve your skills.</p>
